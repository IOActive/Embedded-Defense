# Embedding Defense in Server-Side Applications

Sample embedded defense code to be used in applications written in .NET, Java, PHP and Python.

## Getting Started

A comprehensive list of embedded defense possibilities has been released on the release of the specification ["Embedding Defense in Server-Side Applications"](https://tbd). Based on this specification, examples of defense implementations were built for .NET, Java, PHP and Python applications. Please, keep in mind that this code should be use at your own risk. 

### Deployment

Depending on your language of choice, each code directory includes a - *readme.md* - that details the usage and sample output of the different implementations. Each implementation includes a testing functionality to exemplify how they could be used.
